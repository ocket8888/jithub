# JitHub
JitHub is an integration for JIRA server instances to work seamlessly with GitHub projects.

## Other Projects
In general, this project is the last, desperate hope for a development team forced to use JIRA for a project on GitHub and can't use the official integrations because their JIRA instance isn't cloud-hosted on JIRA's domains. If that doesn't describe your situation, consider instead using one of the following projects:

- [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com) - Agile Project Management in GitHub. Useful for when you aren't actually being forced to use JIRA, just something with similar features.
- [JIRA Software + GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github) - Connect your code with your project management in JIRA. Useful for when your JIRA instance is a cloud instance hosted on JIRA's domains.
